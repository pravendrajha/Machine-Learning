when we increase thd ept of tree , we increase the overfitting in decision tree 

Principle of Occam's razor: Learning simpler decision trees

use simple tree 

Early stopping in learning decision trees --> 
1:- limit the tree depth 
2:-do not consider the split if that does not cause a sufficient decrease in claasification error 
3:-minimum node size :-if data node has very less data point

use classification error to limit the 

Missing data handling :-

# Skip data point with missing value 
# 1:- categorial --> mode 
2:- numeric -->mean / median
