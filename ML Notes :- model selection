how to decide which algo to choose 

Get more traning example --> fixes high variance problem
try smaller set of features --> Fixes high variance 
try getting additional features -> fixing high bias problem
try adding the polynomial features --> fix high bias problem
try decreasing penality --> fixes high bias 
try increasing penality --> fixes high variance
