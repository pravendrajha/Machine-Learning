1:- Super vised
2:- unsupervised 

Others:- Rendom forest,System recommadation


how to decide which algo to choose 


Get more traning example --> fixes high variance problem
try smaller set of features --> Fixes high variance 
try getting additional features -> fixing high bias problem
try adding the polynomial features --> fix high bias problem
try decreasing penality --> fixes high bias 
try increasing penality --> fixes high variance 


Diagonostic:-


Evaluvate hypothesis :-
Split data into training set , and test set 7:3
