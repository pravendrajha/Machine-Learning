Univariate-->  Are we able to classfiy the category  ( if you are able to categories the lebel)
Bivariate -->  if two features are able to define the lebels

Multivariate --> if more than one features are required to identify the 


Pairplot can be generated to do multivariate analysis 

Correlation 

only contigous values can we ploted on pair plot  not categorial values 


Bell curve is required if data is normal distributed 

z-score --> 


Normal & Gausian 
std normal deviation --> mean is 0 and std is 1 

i std --> 68 %
ii 95 %

Probability Density Function => 

Cumalitive Density function => 


what will be change in in y when x is change 

Good Model will be if it has low Bias and Low Variance 

Over Fitting :-  High Variance and low variance 

steep solve always lead to overfitting 

penalyzing the fetaures along with Lambda


magnitude for slope 

Ridig Vs Lasso 
===========

Lasso help in reducing the feature selection where  as ridig doe not 

r2 can be less than zero  if  ssres is > than sstotal

as we are going to add the idenpendent fetaures 
and R2 value is keep on increasing , need to peanalyzed which can be done using adjusted R2

adjusted  R square 


when the features are not corelated than only r square adjusted value will be decreased 

if Rsquare and adjusted R2 values are  high the model is good 



even if indepedent features has not corelated feaures , R2 will be increasing 


ridig use ( Slope square) and lasso uses ( magnitude of slop )


Ridge perform well than lasso but lasso performs well when we have more feautres .

R2 and adjusted R squares 

Rsquare =  1 - (sum of resedual / sum of average total)


Best fit line which one gives less error or minimal error 

zscore = x(i)-mean / std devi


underfiting -> high bias , high variance 

overfiting -> low bias,   high variance 


When we combine week learners , it becomes strong learner 



Explorartory data analaysis :-

imbalanced data set :- where labels counts are not proper

N features  , pair plot has limitation for pair plot , solution is PCA 

if mean = median then no outliers else mean will be high

boxer can help to get the percentile value .

Whiskers --> 1.5 IQR 

violion plots  --> combination of boxer and histogram
